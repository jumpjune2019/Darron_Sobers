# This was a collaberative assignment
Deron Sobers (Myself) and John Mills

assignment: Research arrow functions and create detailed documentation for findings. Refactor MVC_Demo_Upgrade and Timer_Animation_Demo_Upgrade with update arrow functions.

# Me
My job was to created the documenation in Rich Text format on JavaScripts ES6 arrow functions. How they're used, as well as the pros and cons.

# John Mills
Created several Proof of Concepts to provide examples of arrow function implementation.

# Both (Me and John)
We refactored the MVC_Demo_Upgrade and Timer_Animation_Demo_Upgrade to make sure all the functions that could possibly be converted to arrow functions were converted.
